 * The @Configuration annotation tells Spring that this class contains configuration metadata

 * marked with the org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean annotation. 
 * Those methods are called by the Spring Container during bootstrap, and their returning
 * values are treated as Spring‚Äêmanaged beans. The method name is accepted as the bean name 
 * by default. Within a factory method, you created a bean using its concrete class and returned 
 * it after setting its necessary dependencies by calling its setter methods. 
 * Dependencies can also be given as constructor arguments.
